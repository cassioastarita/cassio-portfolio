## Description
The concept of my portfolio is simple and user-friendly. The Design should be clear and easy to read. It was my goal when I started thinking about the design and concept of my portfolio to put focus in the content.

## My plan / approach
My plan is to do the first version of my portfolio using React to show  my projects and work experiences.

Components: Home, About, Projects, Skills, Experience, Resume

## Cool tech that I used

## Lessons you learned
I'm getting more and more comfortable working with React.
CSS is always a big challenge for me, so I need to put focus on that as well.
I am getting better on mobile friendly websites.
